My grandfather had a cine film camera and his films were digitised however they are not in order.

I wrote a program that takes videos divided into scenes and allows the user to label and tag the videos.

The program also allows the user to search for tags and play the selected videos in sequence.

This is useful because relatives often only want to see videos that are relevant to them and sorting through 14 hours of video takes too long.

The program uses FFmpeg to convert the videos into short clips.
