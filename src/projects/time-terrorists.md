For Ludum Dare 47 a friend and I created a game called The Time Terrorists.

The game consisted of the player moving around a two story motel entering rooms and tracking suspects. At the end of a round the game will rewind time to the start allowing the player to perform a whole new set of actions while their past selves continue doing what they did last time. The goal of the game is to defuse the bomb and apprehend the suspect who planted the bomb.

We implemented many complex systems including an ai system to move the suspects around the level peform tasks to confuse the player.

Retrospectively the concept of this game was too complicated for a game jam however the graphics are really nice.
