# rtaw.co.uk

Source code for my personal website at https://rtaw.co.uk/ detailing projects.


## Run locally
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
Also useful commands are
```
npm test
npm run export
```

## Structure
Projects are defined in `src/routes/projects/_projects.js` and often import a markdown file for the content from `src/projects`.
