Getting caught up in the hype for wordle and its variants. I ended up doing a lot of crosswords with friends and wanted a way to create crosswords for each other.

I created a simple website that allows you to create crosswords. It has a number of features such as editing the shape of the crossword and filling out clues. A really useful feature is there is a built-in dictionary that by pressing ? will suggest words that can fit into the letters already placed in the selected answer.

The editor is written in type script without using a frontend framework. The are only a few dev dependencies for development and testing.
