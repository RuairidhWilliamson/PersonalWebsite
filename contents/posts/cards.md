I challenged myself to write a web card game programming in different games.

The entire project runs from a Python server which served static HTML, JavaScript, CSS and image files and hosts websockets connections.

The project includes a room system where users can create private rooms and invite others. Another part of the project was adding bots to play as well.

I came up with different algorithms for the bots and allowed users to choose them.
