2 friends and I participated in an online game jam where we made a game in 72 hours based on a theme.

The theme was announced as Keep it alive. Sam and I designed and programmed the game and Ben created the music.

The goal of the game is to traverse cave levels avoiding traps while keeping alive the light in the genie.

The player can control the brightness of the light however the brighter the light the faster it will deplete if the light depletes completely the game becomes nearly impossible and so the player must optimise their usage of the light to get through the levels.

We used Unity game engine and made 10 levels of increasing difficulty.

After the jam the participants voted on each other's games, and we came 1000th out of 5000 entries.

In the end this was really good practice for completing a task over many days under time pressure in a team.
